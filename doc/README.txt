CS241 Assignment 1

This assignment was pretty challenging! I enjoyed figuring out a method that could
take any index from the heap and return the correct node. The toArray() method and 
getSortedContents() were also tough at first but very rewarding when complete. I had 
slightly edited the getSortedContents() method from what was assigned because you told 
us that it had to be taken from the heap internally, which therefore makes it unnecessary 
to pass in an array. I especially enjoyed helping other out with the assignment too, it seems 
that I had solved some of the hardest problems pretty early on so I was a great help to them.
